# Fraud Detection ML ProjectThis project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions with a Random Forest classifier and SMOTE for handling class imbalance. It includes modular scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.## Project Structure- `data/Fraud_Analysis_Dataset.csv`: Transaction dataset (not included in repo due to size; source it from [add dataset source, e.g., Kaggle link]).- `models/fraud_detection_model.pkl`: Trained Random Forest model (not included; generate via `train_model.py`).- `fraud_detection.py`: Main script with the full pipeline (data loading, preprocessing, training, evaluation, visualization).- `data_preprocessing.py`: Functions for loading and preprocessing data (feature engineering, scaling, encoding).- `train_model.py`: Script to train the model with hyperparameter tuning and save it.- `evaluate_model.py`: Script to evaluate the model’s performance (classification report, ROC AUC, PR AUC).- `prediction_model.py`: Script to predict fraud on new transactions.- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.## Requirements- Python 3.8+- Libraries:  ```bash  pandas  numpy  scikit-learn  imbalanced-learn  matplotlib  seaborn  joblib
